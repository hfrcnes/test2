File organisation
=================

This chapter aims to take a look at the main files and folders of the project.

- ``pyproject.toml`` : this is the describing file, it contains all metadata necessary to describe and make work the project.

- ``makefile`` : it uses `GNU Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html>`__ to have some commands available easily. See :doc:`makefile` to know all available targets.

- ``dist`` : this is the folder in which are the ``.whl`` files after building the lib.   

- ``docs`` : this is where the docs are written and built (see :doc:`docs`).

- ``pygeodes`` : this is the main source folder, where all the python sources are written (see :doc:`sources`).

- ``tests`` : this is where the tests folder, where all the tests cases are written (see :doc:`unit_testing`).

- ``utils`` : this folder contains some useful scripts to help building around the docs (see :doc:`makefile`).
